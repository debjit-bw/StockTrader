# A silly little experiment

I attempted to use news sentiment about a company to predict and trade its shares in the stock market.

I used keyword based news extraction form news sites, and tried using embedding matrices to perform sentiment recognition.

I paired the extracted sentiment embeddings and combined it with the market data to predict the stock price, using a Long Short Term Memory network.
